subtitle: 2020 to present | Founder

I founded the Singapore STEM Club alongside a couple of friends to provide everyone we could with the same wonderful opportunities we had had.

Currently, we have only organised one event: Local Hack Day: Share (SEA Edition). We've got some exciting stuff planned but we're on hold due to COVID-19!
