subtitle: 2018 to 2019 | Founder & CTO
---
I was the co-founder and CTO of CureIO at 13. We won the Young Founders Summit @ SEA pitching competition and then continued to build our company. We focused on creating unprecedented services to assist the elderly. Our solutions centred around the user's heart and we had plans to expand into other areas of medical assistance. The market, however, grew rapidly, leaving our solutions almost obsolete before fully developed. The project would be closed but what I learnt was invaluable.
