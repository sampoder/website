OnePwaa is an international nonprofit ensuring that low-income and marginalized communities have access to debate and essay composition resources. We lower barriers of entry to the concept & practice of collaborative education by providing scholarship programs, debate camps, and online guides.

I am currently a senior member of the web design and development team. I led the complete overhaul of the website when we moved from Weebly to a custom developed solution. To do so we used Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, Javascript & Jekyll. I also did the technical configuration for hosting and the new domain. I had previously done graphic design work before switching teams.
