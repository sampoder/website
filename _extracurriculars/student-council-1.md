For the 2019 to 2020 academic year, I had the honour of serving as the Student Council Vice President. Representing the whole student body has opened me up to the perspectives of others whilst forcing me to go outside of my comfort zone. I never liked going to dances, but I found myself leading the organisation of one!

Here's what I did:

* *Innovation Week -* Innovation Week was the largest ever student led event, bringing together over 100 students to participate in fun, challenging activities focused around technology. The event would also receive support from multiple international organisations. It was very gratifying to see the level of participation in the event!
* *Halloween Disco -* Led the organisation of a large disco with a strong use of technology. This included a custom built ticketing system and a food management system. The event was described as the most meticulously planned disco by our school's principal.
* *Open Mics -* We ran two open mic events to allow students to showcase their talents to the rest of the student body.
* *Sports Matches -* Ran multiple sports matches to increase school spirit.
* *COVID19 Service Project -* Partnered with Cycling without Age to send cards to the elderly of the Sree Narayana Mission during the COVID19 crisis. The project was so impactful that we were featured in the [Straits Times](https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/acts-of-kindness) life section.
* *Vending Machines -* Used my business and financial skills to bring Vending Machines to our school.
